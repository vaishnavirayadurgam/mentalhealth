        <h1>SEXUAL-HARASSMENT HELP LINE</h1>
        <div class="container">
        <p class="mt-4">Sexual harassment is a type of discrimination based on sex. When someone is sexually harassed in schoo/college, it can undermine their sense of personal dignity and safety, disrupt their education, and interfere with their ability to reach their full potential in life. If left unchecked, sexual harassment in the school/college setting has the potential to escalate to violent behaviour, including sexual assault.A student experiencing sexual harassment may stop doing their school/college work and taking part in school-related activities. They may skip or drop classes, or they may drop out of school/college entirely. Psychological effects may include anxiety, depression, disrupted sleep, loss of appetite, inability to concentrate, lowered self-esteem, loss of interest in regular activities, social isolation, and feelings of sadness, fear or shame.</p>

              <p>"Self respect by definition is a confidence and pride in knowing that your behaviour is both honorable and dignified. When you harass or vilify someone, you not only disrespect them, but yourself also.
                Street harassment, sexual violence, sexual harassment, gender-based violence and racism, are all acts committed by a person who in fact has no self respect."</p>
